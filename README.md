# youtube-playlist-downloader

I won't explain how to use it; because it is very simple.
So I'll get to the disadvantages:
- It doesn't give you a choice to choose the path you want to download in.
- It can't be used to download videos in a separated way but with some adjustment it will (I won't do it anytime soon)
- It doesn't download videos with the same speed, it gets fast and slow by time but it isn't slow with all the videos(be patient it is automated process (; ).

- The quality choice may not work to other videos in the playlist as the script makes you choose the quality based on the first video's qualities.(I didn't have this problem yet but feel free to drop on my twitter https://twitter.com/AhmedTareq224)
